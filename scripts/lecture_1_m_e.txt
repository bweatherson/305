Hello, and welcome to Philosophy 305 - Introduction to Formal Methods

Lecture 8 - Indirect Derivations

<new slide>

This is going to be a bit shorter than last time. The plan is to work through one example of an **indirect** derivation.

<new slide>

The material is from chapter 4 of the Carnap book.

<new slide>

In that book, indirect derivations are used for proving conditionals. Intuitively, the way to show that if A is true, then so is B, is to assume, or imagine, or suppose, that A is true, and see if we can work out B. And that's exactly what we'll do here.

<new slide>

There are three tricks.

First, the 'Show' is a conditional, not a simple sentence.

Second, the proof starts with a new kind of line, an **assumption*.

Third, the proof ends with CD, for conditional derivation, not DD, for direct derivation. And CD has its own, slightly fussy, rules.

<new slide> 

So here is the example we're going to work through. It has one premise and a conclusion. The premise is If P then Q. The conclusion is If P then not not Q. It's not very exciting! But it's good to use simple examples to see how the system works.

Note that what we write in 'Show' is still the conclusion of the argument, If P then not not Q. But that's not the last line of the proof.

<new slide>

We start with two kinds of underived lines. First, assumptions, and second premises.

<new slide>

The premises, in this case line 3, are familiar from previous examples.

<new slide>

What's new is the **assumption**. It is the thing on the left of the conditional you're trying to prove. It's the **antecedent** of the conditional you're trying to prove.

<new slide>

Then inside the proof, you use the all the same rules. Every rule that is ok to use in a direct derivation, is ok to use in an indirect derivation.

<new slide>

The big difference in conditional proofs is that you don't end with the Show line. Instead  you end with the **consequent** of what you're trying to show. Remember, that's the thing to the right of the arrow.

<new slide>

And then (and this is a bit distinctive to Carnap), you write 'CD' for Conditional Derivation, not 'DD' for Direct Derivation. And that's it!

<new slide>

OK, that's enough for this lecture, and indeed for today. For Wednesday, read chapters 5 and 6 of Carnap.

We're going to talk a bit about what happens when these derivations get nested.

And now we should have gone over enough for you to do at least some of this week's exercises, so you should start on them while this materal is relatively fresh.
