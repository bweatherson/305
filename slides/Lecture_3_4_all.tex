\item
  The backstory is that during WWII the Allies were losing a lot of
  planes to German artillery.
\item
  They were thinking about how to add armor to the planes in order to
  defend them better.
\item
  So they investigated the planes that had come back to see where they
  were getting most bullet holes, and planned to add extra armor to
  those parts.

\protect\hypertarget{hypothesis-one---the-original-airforce-view}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The planes coming back are our best sample of the planes in the field.
\item
  The bullet holes in them are asymmetrically distributed.
\item
  So that's evidence that certain parts of the planes are more likely to
  get hit.
\item
  And that's where we should add extra protection.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Two - Wald's View}
\protect\hypertarget{hypothesis-two---walds-view}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bullet holes are almost surely randomly distributed.
\item
  The planes coming back are not a random sample of the planes in the
  air.
\item
  They do not include all of the planes that crashed.
\item
  The best explanation of the asymmetry is that the `missing' bullet
  holes are for the planes that crashed.
\item
  And the best explantion in turn for that is that those are the places
  where bullet holes are fatal to the plane.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Who Was Right}
\protect\hypertarget{who-was-right}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We nowadays think Wald was.
\item
  Artillery, especially artillery of that era, is really a random
  process.
\item
  Moreover, the places with no holes - the engines and the cockpit - are
  just where you'd expect fatal injuries to occur.
\item
  So the thing to do was to protect those areas, and try to turn fatal
  injuries into non-fatal ones.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Big Lesson}
\protect\hypertarget{big-lesson}{}

When you see that \(p\) is true, there are two different possible
lessons to learn.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \(p\) is true.
\item

\end{enumerate}

Very often, the second is the right lesson to draw.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A plane comes back with a bullethole in its left wing.
\item
  That tells us that this plane got shot in the left wing.
\item
  It also tells us, from the fact that we can see that this plane got
  shot in the left wing, that this damage is non-fatal.

\begin{frame}{Big Picture}
\protect\hypertarget{big-picture}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We want to learn from our evidence.

  evidence.
\item
  And to do that it helps to have a theory about how to think about how
  evidence bears on uncertainty.

\begin{frame}{Basic Idea}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A probability function is a mapping from possibilities to numbers.
\item
  The numbers must sum to one.
\item
  Intuitively, the numbers measure how likely the possibilities are.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sum to One}
\protect\hypertarget{sum-to-one}{}

The math of probability functions is just the math of proportions.
Ultimately, all we'll be doing is the same kind of math that you would
do when thinking about things like

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What proportion of UM students are from North Carolina?
\item
  What proportion of UM undergraduates are Tigers fans?

\protect\hypertarget{a-simple-case}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Imagine that it is basketball season, and UM has planned to have both
  the women's and men's teams play on the same night.
\item
  So at the end of the night there are four possible outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Made Up Probabilities}
\protect\hypertarget{made-up-probabilities}{}

I'll stipulate that the probabilities of the four possible outcomes are
given by this table.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
& Men Win & Men Lose\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Women Win & 0.45 & 0.25\tabularnewline

\end{longtable}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Possibilities}
\protect\hypertarget{possibilities}{}

Say a possibility (for current purposes) is one of these maximally
specific things that the probability is defined over.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is not really a complete possibility.
\item
  It doesn't tell us the score, or the weather, or the results of the
  next election, or for that matter the results of the last election.
\item
  But it tells us everything that's relevant to a particular inquiry.
\item
  It is a lot like a line on a truth table.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Events}
\protect\hypertarget{events}{}

We will say an \textbf{event} is a proposition that can be defined using
these possibilities. So here are some sample events.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The women's team wins.
\item
  The men's team wins.
\item
  At least one Michigan team wins.
\item
  The two teams have the same result.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability of Events}
\protect\hypertarget{probability-of-events}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An event is true at some possibilities, false at others.
\item
  Each possibility gets a probability.
\item
  The probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the
  possibilities where it is true.
\end{itemize}

This will involve a lot of guesswork - do not make investment decisions
on the basis of the numbers I'm about to use because they are really
pulled out of the air - but it's a very helpful heuristic to at least
approximate the reality.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probabilities of States}
\protect\hypertarget{probabilities-of-states}{}

This could be embarrassingly out of date by the time we even do the
classes, but let's say the probabilities look like this.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Not impeached - 20\%, or 0.2.
\item
  Impeached but not convicted - 70\%, or 0.7.
\item
  Impeached and convicted, i.e., removed - 10\%, or 0.1
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Win Probabilities}
\protect\hypertarget{win-probabilities}{}

Then we want to work out how likely it is that Trump wins given each of
those states.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Not Impeached}
\protect\hypertarget{not-impeached}{}

If he's not impeached, then probably Democrats are panicking, and he's
in a strong position to win, so let's say that's a 60\%, or 0.6, win
probability.

\bigskip

So that would mean that there's a 40\%, or 0.4, lose probability.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  I'm totally happy to revise these numbers if the class thinks they are
  absurd - I can't emphasis this enough that I'm literally making these
  numbers up.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Impeached but not Convicted}
\protect\hypertarget{impeached-but-not-convicted}{}

That's basically the status quo, and the status quo is that he's behind
in the polls but not by so much that he couldn't win, so let's call that
a 40\%, or 0.4, win probability, and hence a 60\%, or 0.6, lose
probability.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Impeached and Convicted}
\protect\hypertarget{impeached-and-convicted}{}

Now we're in really unknown territory, because this has literally never
happened. It would be a Lazarus like comeback to win from here, but
stranger things have happened. Say his win probability now drops to
10\%, or 0.1. (Largely because he's really unlikely to even be the
Republican candidate in this scenario.)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Giant Table}
\protect\hypertarget{the-giant-table}{}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
& Trump wins & Trump loses\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Not impeached & \(0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12\) &
\(0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08\)\tabularnewline
Impeached but not convicted & \(0.7 \times 0.4 = 0.28\) &
\(0.7 \times 0.6 = 0.42\)\tabularnewline
Impeaches and convicted & \(0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01\) &
\(0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.09\)\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

So the probability that he wins (given our very rough assumptions) is
\(0.12 + 0.28 + 0.01 = 0.41\), or 41\%.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probabilities and Errors}
\protect\hypertarget{probabilities-and-errors}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The error bars on that calculation are massive.
\item
  But it's a kind of sanity check on how you think things are going.
\item
  Especially in situations where only a handful of paths lead to a
  salient result (like in playoffs in sports, or when thinking about the
  likelihood of a particular challenger winning), doing the tree even
  with favorable numbers can give you a conservative estimate of some
  probability.

There is a big soccer tournament this weekend. The teams competing are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fireflies
\item
  Penguins
\item
  Huskies
\item
  Bluebirds
\end{itemize}

There will be three games.

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Fireflies vs Penguins
\item
  Huskies vs Bluebirds
\item
  Winner of Game 1 vs Winner of Game 2
\end{enumerate}

Each game will have a winner one way or the other (maybe via penalty

\begin{frame}{Team Strength}
\protect\hypertarget{team-strength}{}

The teams are not all equally good. They each have a `strength'. Here is
their respective strengths

\endhead
Fireflies & 5\tabularnewline

\begin{frame}{Win Probabilities}
\protect\hypertarget{win-probabilities-1}{}

If a team with strength \(x\) plays a team with strength \(y\), the team
with strength \(x\) will win with probability

\[
\frac{x}{x+ y}

And the team with strength \(y\) will win with probability

\[
\frac{y}{x + y}
\]

\protect\hypertarget{intuitions}{}

This isn't an easy question to answer intuitively.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is more likely that the Huskies will be actually in the final -
  because they are the better team.
\item
  But it is more likely that the Fireflies will win against the

  It isn't always easy to intuitively balance these forces.

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The left-hand side means ``The probability of \(A\) given \(B\).''
  \pause

  \(A \wedge B\) divided by the probability of \(B\).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fireflies}
\protect\hypertarget{fireflies}{}

\[
\Pr(HR | FC) = \frac{\Pr(HR \wedge FC)}{\Pr(FC)}
\]

That is, the probability that the Huskies are runners-up (\(HR\)) given
that the Fireflies are champions (\$FC), is given by the formula on the
right.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fireflies}
\protect\hypertarget{fireflies-1}{}

\[
\Pr(HR | FC) = \frac{0.26}{0.26+0.116} = \frac{0.26}{0.376} \approx 0.691
\] So conditional on the Fireflies winning, it's just under 70\% likely
they beat the Huskies.

\begin{frame}{Updating}
\protect\hypertarget{updating}{}

A big thing we'll talk about after Fall break is this philosophical
claim

\[
\Pr{}_B(A) = \Pr(A | B)
\]

The way to read that is saying that the conditional probability of \(A\)
after learning \(B\) equals the conditional probability of \(A\) given
\(B\). This claim - and it is a philosophical claim not a mathematical
one - is a big part of why we care about conditional probability.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let \(X_1, \dots, X_n\) be a partition of possibility space.
\item
  Then \(B\) is equivalent to
  \((B \wedge X_1) \vee \dots \vee (B \wedge X_n)\).
\item
  So \(\Pr(B) = \Pr(B \wedge X_1) + \dots + \Pr(B \wedge X_n)\)
\item
  And we can use that to get the very general form of Bayes's theorem
\end{itemize}

\[
\Pr(X_i | B) = \frac{\Pr(B | X_i)\Pr(X_i)}{\sum_{k=1}^n \Pr(B | X_k)\Pr(X_k)}

So if you know the prior probability of each cell in the partition, and
the probability of \(B\) conditional on each cell, you can work out the
probability of being in a particular cell given \(B\).

  Even if there aren't yellow cabs, they might see it as yellow. (Maybe

  A \textbf{random variable} is simply a variable that takes different
  numerical values in different states.
\item
  In other words, it is a function from possibilities to numbers.
\item
  It need not be `random' in any familiar sense.
\item
  The function from possible situations to the value of 2 + 2 in that
  situation is a random variable, albeit a constant one.
\item
  It's just a slightly confusing term for any variable that takes
  different, numerical, values in different situations.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Labels}
\protect\hypertarget{labels}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Typically, random variables are denoted by capital letters.
\item
  So we might have a random variable \(X\) whose value is the age of the
  next President of the United States, and his or her inauguration.
\item
  Or we might have a random variable \(Y\) that is the number of
  children you will have in your lifetime.
\item
  Basically any mapping from possibilities to numbers can be a random
  variable.

  You've asked each of your friends who will win the Michigan v
  Maryland.
\item
  12 said Michigan will win.
\item
  7 said Maryland will win. \pause

  Then we can let \(X\) be a random variable measuring the number of
  your friends who correctly predicted the result of the game.
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation*}
X = 
    \begin{cases}
        12,& \text{if the home team wins} ,\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Given a random variable \(X\) and a probability function \(Pr\), we
  can work out the \textbf{expected value} of that random variable with
  respect to that probability function.
\item
  Intuitively, the expected value of \(X\) is a weighted average of the
  possible values of \(X\), where the weights are given by the
  probability (according to \(Pr\)) of each value coming about.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Calculating Expected Value}
\protect\hypertarget{calculating-expected-value}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  More formally, we work out the expected value of \(X\) this way.
\item
  For each possibility, we multiply the value of \(X\) in that case by
  the probability of the possibility obtaining.
\item
  Then we sum the numbers we've got, and the result is the expected
  value of \(X\).
\item
  We'll write the expected value of \(X\) as \(Exp(X)\).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Back to the Example}

 &= 10.5

\begin{frame}{Notes}
\protect\hypertarget{notes}{}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  The expected value of \(X\) isn't in any sense the value that we

\item
  If this kind of situation recurs a lot, you would expect the long run
  average value \(X\) takes to be roundabout the expected value.
\item
  That's a better way of conceptualising what expected values are.

  That's what makes the conflicting interests (in dollar terms) into a

\begin{frame}{Sure Thing Principle}
\protect\hypertarget{sure-thing-principle}{}

Assume two bets A and B have the following characteristic.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For some proposition \(p\), A and B have the exact same return. \pause
\end{itemize}

Then the Sure Thing Principle says the following.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Changing what that return is won't change your preference between A
  and B.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Intuitive Example}
\protect\hypertarget{intuitive-example}{}

Assume that B is a \textbf{conditional bet} - a bet on \(q\) that only
takes place if \(p\) is true. So if you take the bet, the following
things happen.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  So if \(p\) is true, and \(q\) is true, you win, let's say, \$10.
\item
  If \(p\) is true, and \(q\) is false, you lose \$10.
\item
  But if \(p\) is false, then the bet is called off.
\end{itemize}

E.g., you might bet a friend that if Biden is the Democratic nominee, he
wins the election. The bet is simply called off if he isn't the nominee.
Let A be the action of simply not taking this bet, and staying at the
status quo.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Change}
\protect\hypertarget{a-change}{}

You find out, apparently because you've been doing more gambling in your
spare time than is good for you, that you have another bet that wins \$5

  Could this change your preferences over A vs B?
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Argument for No}
\protect\hypertarget{the-argument-for-no}{}

Either \(p\) is true or it isn't.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If it is, then you should still be indifferent between A and B.
\item
  If it is not, then what outcome you would have gotten if \(p\) were
  true shouldn't make a difference to whether you prefer A or B.
\item
  And this doesn't look like it just applies to this case.
\item
  It looks like a perfectly general weak dominance argument.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Orthodox expected utility theory, the theory that says you should
  maximise expected utility, puts very few constraints on individual
  choices.
\item
  But it puts quite striking constraints on sets of choices.
\item
  It says you can't prefer A to B, and B to C, and C to A, for example.
\item
  And it says that the Sure Thing Principle, a principle about what

Maurice Allais (1911-2010) developed the most famous objection to the
Sure Thing Principle.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is a pair of two-way choices, and an intuitively rational pair of
  preferences among them.

  Expected utility can make sense of either one of the pair, but not
  both.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Allais - First Part}

You have a choice between:

A. A 10\% chance of \$5,000,000. B. An 11\% chance of \$1,000,000.

What do you choose?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Allais - Second Part}
\protect\hypertarget{allais---second-part}{}

That was a hypothetical. Now for real you have a choice between:

C. A 10\% chance of \$5,000,000, an 89\% chance of \$1,000,000, and a
1\% chance of nothing. D. \$1,000,000.

What do you choose?

\end{frame}

\protect\hypertarget{allaiss-argument}{}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  It is rational to prefer A to B, and D to C. \pause

  to C. \pause

\end{itemize}

All that changed from AB to CD was that we changed how much the payout
was if Maize, without changing the fact that it was equal.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Expected Utility Theory Can't Handle This}
\protect\hypertarget{why-expected-utility-theory-cant-handle-this}{}

Let \(u(5M) = x\) and \(u(1M) = y\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If A is preferred to B, then \(0.1x > 0.11y\), since those are the
  expected utilities of A and B. \pause
\item
  So adding \(0.89y\) to both sides, we get \(0.1x + 0.89y > y\). \pause
\item
  But those just are the expected utilities of C and D.
\item
  So if A is preferred to B, then C is preferred to D.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An argument against Allais}
\protect\hypertarget{an-argument-against-allais}{}

Assume you'll find out, both in the AB case and the CD case, whether the
marble was maize, or not-maize before you are told its color.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At that point, in the AB case, what will you wish you'd chosen? \pause
\item
  If B, or you are indifferent, then you shouldn't have preferred A in
  the first place. \pause
\item
  If A, then do the same thing in the CD case.
\item
  If you find out the marble is maize, you don't care.
\item
  If you find out it's not maize, then you're back in the exact same
  puzzle, so you should prefer C to D.
\item
  So by weak dominance, you should prefer C to D overall.

\item
  Very roughly, you replace the \(Pr\) in expected utility theory with
  some function \(f(Pr)\) where \(f\) measures the agent's attitude to
  risk.
\item
  If \(f(x) < x\), the agent is risk averse, if \(f(x) > x\) they are

  What do we mean by saying that something is probable, or that it is
  80\% likely, or that its probability is 40\%? \pause

  What should we mean by those things? What meanings would be mostly
  useful for conversational purposes, scientific purposes, etc?
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Caveats}
\protect\hypertarget{caveats}{}

First, a caveat.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There probably isn't a single good answer to either of these
  questions.
\item
  That we actually do things a certain way is some evidence that that's
  a good way to do it, but far from compelling evidence.
\item
  And what is useful in the context of physical science is probably
  different to what's useful in social science and is probbably
  different again to what's useful in everyday life. \pause
\end{itemize}

But let's see how we can do by ignoring all this and finding a single
meaning for probability.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability is Everywhere}
\protect\hypertarget{probability-is-everywhere}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Most, maybe all, human languages have terms for something like
  probability. \pause
\item
  Saying ``Probably'' feels like an answer, and not just a response, to
  being asked whether \(p\) is true.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Objective or Subjective}
\protect\hypertarget{objective-or-subjective}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Objective theories say that probability is something about the world.
\item
  Subjective theories say that probability is something about minds.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{One Paradigm Objective Theory}
\protect\hypertarget{one-paradigm-objective-theory}{}

Probability is frequency.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To say that the probability the roulette wheel will land 17 is
  \(\frac{1}{38}\) just is to say that the proportion of spins that land
  17 is \(\frac{1}{38}\).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Advantages}
\protect\hypertarget{advantages}{}

\begin{itemize}

\end{frame}

\protect\hypertarget{disadvantages}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Need extra complications to deal with cyclic events. The probability
  that it's now daytime is not 0.5, although the proportions of times
  that are daytime is 0.5. \pause
\item
  Implies that one-off events do not have a defined probablity. But we
  can say, for instance, that it is very probable that Oswald killed
  Kennedy.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reference Class}
\protect\hypertarget{reference-class}{}

Thinking of probabilities as frequencies requires a reference class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Think about what the probability is that I'm right handed.
\item
  Is it the frequency of right-handedness amongst:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Humans? \pause
  \item
    Adult male humans? \pause
  \item
    Australians? \pause
  \item
    Michigan faculty? \pause
  \item
    Philosophy faculty? \pause
  \item
    Australians who are on the philosophy faculty at Michigan?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The last of these is a singleton class, so the probability is 0 or 1.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Subjective Theory}
\protect\hypertarget{subjective-theory}{}

Probability is degree of confidence.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Questions}

\item
  Whose confidence? \pause
\item
  Actual confidence or idealised confidence?
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Actual}
\protect\hypertarget{actual}{}

Question 2 seems easiest to answer.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No matter how confident you or I am that the moon is made of green
  cheese, it is not probable that the moon is made of green cheese.
\item
  If we're really confident that it is, then we're getting something
  very badly wrong.
\item
  But if probability just was how confident we actually are in
  something, then it would be probable that the moon is made of green
  cheese.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Idealised}
\protect\hypertarget{idealised}{}

A better view is, as the textbook says, that

\begin{quote}
Probability is ultimately about belief. It's about how certain you
should be that something is true.
\end{quote}

So not what you actually believe, but what you should believe. This gets
out of the green cheese problem.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Several Challenges}
\protect\hypertarget{several-challenges}{}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Why think that `how certain you should be that something is true'
  obeys these rules? \pause
\item
  Who is the `you' in how certain you should be that something is true?
  \pause
\item
  What happens if rationality is \textbf{permissive}; there are several
  attitudes you can rationally have about how likely something is?
  \pause
\item
  Especially if that last one is true, how does probability have a role
  to play in objective science? \pause
\item
  How do we even measure how confident people, real or idealised, are in
  propositions? \pause
\end{enumerate}

We could do weeks on every one of these questions, but I'll focus on
3/4.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bayesianism}
\protect\hypertarget{bayesianism}{}

The main subjective theory is known as Bayesianism.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  though mostly terminological question.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conditionalisation}
\protect\hypertarget{conditionalisation}{}

The core principle behind Bayesianism is that updating is by
conditionalisation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That is, the new \(\Pr(H)\) after getting evidence \(E\) is the old
  \(\Pr(H | E)\).
\item
  And \(\Pr(H | E)\) is given by the formula.
\end{itemize}

\[
\Pr(H | E) = \frac{\Pr(E | H)\Pr(H)}{\Pr(E)}
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem of the Priors}
\protect\hypertarget{problem-of-the-priors}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That tells you how to convert an old probability into a new
  probability given some evidence \(E\).
\item
  That is, it tells you how to generate a \textbf{posterior}
  probability. \pause
\item
  But it does not tell you where the \textbf{prior} probability comes
  from.
\item
  And this question is one that Bayesians have never quite had a good
  answer to.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Green Cheese}
\protect\hypertarget{green-cheese}{}

To make the problem vivid, imagine that I start out with the following
probabilities.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability that the moon is made of green cheese is 0.99.
\item
  The things that happen around here are probabilistically independent
  of hypotheses about the material composition of the moon.
\end{itemize}

The first of these is absurd, but the second isn't ridiculous I suppose.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Updating}
\protect\hypertarget{updating-1}{}

Now some stuff happens, I get evidence \(E\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let \(H\) be that the moon is made of green cheese.
\item
  Since \(\Pr(H) = 0.99\), and \(H\) is independent of \(E\), it follows
  that \(\Pr(H | E) = 0.99\). \pause
\item
  So the Bayesians' favourite updating rule says that the new
  probability for \(H\) should be 0.99. \pause
\item
  But that's fairly absurd - what could it mean to say that I
  \textbf{should} have probability 0.99 in \(H\)?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Available Moves Here}
\protect\hypertarget{two-available-moves-here}{}

\item
  Say what the one true prior is - and say that there are two rules: use

\item
  Say that there are a large class of acceptable priors, and argue that
  conditionalising any of them with enough evidence will produce a
  rational outcome. \pause
\end{enumerate}

sympathetic to option 1, but in the 20th century, most of the focus was
on option 2.

\begin{frame}{Symmetry}
\protect\hypertarget{symmetry}{}

There is a natural way to start looking for the one true prior.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When we do probabilities involving games of chance, we naturally take
  the different possibilities as having equal probability.
\item
  So when we give equal probability to heads and tails, or to each
  marble being drawn, or each side of the die coming up, that doesn't
  seem to be based on a careful analysis of coins, marbles or dice.
\item
  Rather, it's just natural to divide probability evenly among the
  possibilities.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Caveat}
\protect\hypertarget{a-caveat}{}

There is one way in which it is more complicated than that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We don't give any probability to the coin landing on its edge, or the
  die landing on a corner.
\item
  I suspect this is because we've observed a lot about the world from a
  very young age, and noticed things like that just don't happen.
\item
  This complicates the narrative that we're just using some natural
  principle of prior probability.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logical Probability}
\protect\hypertarget{logical-probability}{}

The very rough idea is that there are logical symmetry principles, and
the prior probability function is one that respects these symmetries.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(p\) is a proposition that things are one side of one of these
  lines of symmetry in logical space, the prior probability of \(p\) is
  0.5. \pause
\item
  Don't think about this too hard because it isn't actually going to
  work.
\item
  The problem is that there are too many symmetries.

\begin{frame}{Problem}
\protect\hypertarget{problem}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  These are the same question!
\item
  To say the sides are between 0 and 2 just is to say the volume is
  between 0 and 8.
\item
  And to say that the side length is at most 1 just is to say that the
  volume is at most 1.
\item
  If we try to respect all intuitive symmetries, we are led into
  inconsistency.

\begin{frame}{Principle of Indifference}
\protect\hypertarget{principle-of-indifference}{}

The intuitive rule we've been discussing here has a name, the Principle
of Indifference.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It says that given a partition of possibility space into \(n\)
  possibilities, and no reason to give higher probability to any one of
  them, give each of them probability \(\frac{1}{n}\).
\item
  But this is incoherent - since the possibility that the cubes are
  under 1 is both part of a 2-way partition (the partition by side
  lengths) and an 8-way partitio (the partition by volumes).

\item
  So if I start out 50/50 between the options, and get more than 60
  heads, I'll end up massively leaning towards scenario 1. \pause
\item
  But imagine Calum starts out thinking that option 2 is really likely -
  0.99 likely and option 1 only 0.01.
\item

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That is, the new \(\Pr(H)\) after getting evidence \(E\) is the old
  \(\Pr(H | E)\).
\item
  And \(\Pr(H | E)\) is given by the formula.
\end{itemize}

\[
\Pr(H | E) = \frac{\Pr(E | H)\Pr(H)}{\Pr(E)}
\]

\begin{frame}{Problem of the Priors}
\protect\hypertarget{problem-of-the-priors-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That tells you how to convert an old probability into a new
  probability given some evidence \(E\).
\item
  That is, it tells you how to generate a \textbf{posterior}
  probability. \pause
\item
  But it does not tell you where the \textbf{prior} probability comes
  from.
\item
  And this question is one that Bayesians have never quite had a good
  answer to.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Green Cheese}
\protect\hypertarget{green-cheese-1}{}

To make the problem vivid, imagine that I start out with the following
probabilities.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability that the moon is made of green cheese is 0.99.
\item
  The things that happen around here are probabilistically independent
  of hypotheses about the material composition of the moon.
\end{itemize}

The first of these is absurd, but the second isn't ridiculous I suppose.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Updating}
\protect\hypertarget{updating-2}{}

Now some stuff happens, I get evidence \(E\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let \(H\) be that the moon is made of green cheese.
\item
  Since \(\Pr(H) = 0.99\), and \(H\) is independent of \(E\), it follows
  that \(\Pr(H | E) = 0.99\). \pause
\item
  So the Bayesians' favourite updating rule says that the new
  probability for \(H\) should be 0.99. \pause
\item
  But that's fairly absurd - what could it mean to say that I
  \textbf{should} have probability 0.99 in \(H\)?
\end{itemize}

  the one true prior, and update it by conditionalisation. \pause
\item
  Say that there are a large class of acceptable priors, and argue that
  conditionalising any of them with enough evidence will produce a
  rational outcome. \pause
\end{enumerate}

The very rough history of this is that 19th century folks were
sympathetic to option 1, but in the 20th century, most of the focus was
on option 2.

\section{One True Prior}\label{one-true-prior-1}}

\begin{frame}{Symmetry}
\protect\hypertarget{symmetry-1}{}

There is a natural way to start looking for the one true prior.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When we do probabilities involving games of chance, we naturally take
  the different possibilities as having equal probability.
\item
  So when we give equal probability to heads and tails, or to each
  marble being drawn, or each side of the die coming up, that doesn't
  seem to be based on a careful analysis of coins, marbles or dice.
\item
  Rather, it's just natural to divide probability evenly among the
  possibilities.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Caveat}
\protect\hypertarget{a-caveat-1}{}

There is one way in which it is more complicated than that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We don't give any probability to the coin landing on its edge, or the
  die landing on a corner.
\item
  I suspect this is because we've observed a lot about the world from a
  very young age, and noticed things like that just don't happen.
\item
  This complicates the narrative that we're just using some natural
  principle of prior probability.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logical Probability}
\protect\hypertarget{logical-probability-1}{}

The very rough idea is that there are logical symmetry principles, and
the prior probability function is one that respects these symmetries.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(p\) is a proposition that things are one side of one of these
  lines of symmetry in logical space, the prior probability of \(p\) is
  0.5. \pause
\item
  Don't think about this too hard because it isn't actually going to
  work.
\item
  The problem is that there are too many symmetries.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem}
\protect\hypertarget{problem-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  These are the same question!
\item
  To say the sides are between 0 and 2 just is to say the volume is
  between 0 and 8.
\item
  And to say that the side length is at most 1 just is to say that the
  volume is at most 1.
\item
  If we try to respect all intuitive symmetries, we are led into
  inconsistency.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Principle of Indifference}
\protect\hypertarget{principle-of-indifference-1}{}

The intuitive rule we've been discussing here has a name, the Principle
of Indifference.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It says that given a partition of possibility space into \(n\)
  possibilities, and no reason to give higher probability to any one of
  them, give each of them probability \(\frac{1}{n}\).
\item
  But this is incoherent - since the possibility that the cubes are
  under 1 is both part of a 2-way partition (the partition by side
  lengths) and an 8-way partitio (the partition by volumes).

\begin{frame}{Convergence}

\begin{itemize}

  I am really not going to go over the details of this.

  According to any function in the class, the probability that evidence

\begin{frame}{Intuitive Case}
\protect\hypertarget{intuitive-case-1}{}

Imagine that I know a coin is biased in 1 of 2 ways.

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Each flip has probability 0.8 of landing heads.
\item
  Each flip has probability 0.2 of landing heads.
\end{enumerate}

Then I get to flip the coin 100 times. What will happen?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Convergence}
\protect\hypertarget{convergence-5}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On scenario 1, the probability that I'll get at least 60 heads is
  greater than 0.99999.
\item
  But on scenaio 2, the probability of that is less than \(10^{-10}\).
\item
  So if I start out 50/50 between the options, and get more than 60
  heads, I'll end up massively leaning towards scenario 1. \pause
\item
  But imagine Calum starts out thinking that option 2 is really likely -
  0.99 likely and option 1 only 0.01.
\item
  He will also get to the right view after 100 trials - even 60 heads
  (which is really low on scenario 1) would be enough to change the
  probabilities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

  The subjective approach is very popular within philosophy, but not
  within statistics or a lot of social sciences.
\item
  This is in part because of its subjectivity.
\item
  A lot of sciences want methods that are more objective.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Significance Testing}
\protect\hypertarget{significance-testing-1}{}

What is known as `classical statistics' is based around the idea of
significance testing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The intuitive idea is that we say that a correlation reflects a real
  pattern in the underlying data if (but only if) it would be really
  improbable if we got the data we did by chance.
\item
  Intuitively, three heads in a row might be a coincidence, but ten
  heads in a row suggests something odd is going on.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Significance Testing}
\protect\hypertarget{significance-testing-2}{}

So say that we want to argue that two things are connected.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To make this concrete, say that we want to argue that the survival
  rates for people who take our company's drug are higher than for
  people who do not.
\item
  What we do is give a bunch of people the drug (after getting all the
  approvals!)
\item
  We then look at their survival rates, and ask \emph{How likely would
  this data be if our drug had no effect at all}?
\item
  If that number is low enough, we conclude that our drug works.
  (Profit!)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Significance Testing}
\protect\hypertarget{significance-testing-3}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That is, we work out something like \(\Pr(E | H_0)\), where \(E\) is
  the data that we get, and \(H_0\) is a \textbf{null hypothesis} that
  says there is nothing of interest here.
\item
  If \(\Pr(E | H_0)\) is low enough, we conclude that \(H_0\) is false,
  and hopefully there is a natural alternative to \(H_0\), such as that
  the drug works, that we infer.
\item
  In those cases, we will say that the data shows a significant
  correlation between taking the drug and survival rates.
\item
  This literally means that it would be really improbable to get this
  data by chance.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Significance Testing}
\protect\hypertarget{significance-testing-4}{}

How low is `really low'?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As the book says, this is mostly a matter of convention.
\item
  Which is ironic given the whole point was to get away from
  subjectivity.
\item
  But a common idea is that it is less than 5\%.
\item
  So a correlation is significant if it is outside the central 95\% of
  the distribution.

\begin{itemize}

  conclusion that \(\Pr(H_0 | E)\) is low, something that we've said
  over and over again not to do? \pause
\item
  Yes, but\ldots{} \pause
\item
  In practice the method is supplemented by practical rules that avoid
  the worst consequences of allowing these inversions.

\begin{frame}{Stopping Rules}
\protect\hypertarget{stopping-rules}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As it stands, this method leads to all sorts of nonsense and, frankly,
  fraud.
\item
  It needs to be supplemented with extra rules to avoid obvious
  mistakes.
\item
  The first thing that is needed, as was realised fairly early on, was a
  commitment to external `stopping rules'.
\item
  If you are allowed to keep collecting data until the probability of
  the evidence given the null is low, you will almost always get to
  reject the null.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  I'm going to simulate tossing a coin 100,000 times.
\item
  It uses the computer's random number generator, and it is set up so
  the probability of heads on each toss is 0.5, and the tosses are
  independent.
\item
  But I'm going to measure the probability of the evidence given the
  null after each toss, not just at the end.
\item
  And by `the probability of the evidence', I mean the probability of
  getting at least that many heads.
\item
  If that is outside \([0.025, 0.975]\) then we have, at this point, a
  rejection of the null.
\item
  This is absurd of course; the null is programmed to be true.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The solution to this problem (which I hope the numbers came out right
  on!) is to require that scientists \textbf{pre-register} their
  hypotheses.
\item
  So you can't collect data then see what it supports, but have to say
  that one particular thing is what you're testing.
\item
  This is still in the process of becoming a universal requirement in
  respectable science; it was very much not part of standard scientific
  practice 10-20 years ago.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Should we trust a method if it requires these ad hoc rules like
  announced stopping rules and pre-registration? \pause
\item
  Maybe! It depends on the alternatives.
\item
  But when you see a report on a statistical finding, you should really
  check if it satisfies these conditions.
\item
  And if it comes from a for-profit entity, you should be really
  sceptical that it does unless they are super transparent.
