## Aim of Course

Introductory survey of some formal methods that are of broad philosophical use.

## Three Sections

> 1. Propositional Logic
> 2. Probability and Statistical Reasoning
> 3. Modal Logic and Conditionals

## Propositional Logic

- This is the logic of sentences that can be true or false, and that can combine to form longer sentences. 
- So as well as looking at simple sentences, like _Nadia sings_, we will look at sentences that are built from simple sentences.
- Examples of such sentences are _Nadia doesn't sing_, _Nadia sings and Bethany dances_, and _If Nadia sings, Simone sleeps_.

## Probability and Statistical Reasoning

> - Sometimes we can't infer that a conclusion is definitely true, but we can infer that it is probably true.
> - We will look at some tools for regimenting how and when we make such inference. 

## Modal Logic

This is the logic of 'must' and 'might'.  It has as many applications as there are interpretations of 'must' and 'might'. The primary interpretations we'll look at are:

> - Metaphysical 
> - Epistemological  
> - Moral 

## Textbooks

There are three - all of them available through Canvas.

1. _The Carnap Book_ by Graham Leach-Krouse
2. _Odds and Ends_ by Jonathan Weisberg
3. _Boxes and Diamonds, Ann Arbor remix_

The three books are for the three parts of the course.

## Logistics

- These lectures are going to be very short.
- That's in part because it's really hard to retain focus through a long logic video, and in part because it's easier to manage uploads and downloads with smaller files.
- So we'll typically have somewhere between 6 and 10 'lectures' each week, though each will be 5 to 15 minutes.

## Access

- These slides don't have captioning.
- But the script I'm reading off is available on Canvas, and that should be more reliable than automated captions.
- The script also says where the slide jumps are, so if you don't want to listen to me, you can just read along the script plus the slides.

## Assessment

- The primary assessment will be weekly assignments, which will be administered through Canvas.
- These are already all posted, and they will be due each week on Friday at 5pm.
- There will also be an end of term exam, also through Canvas.

## Office Hours

- The lectures as you can tell are all going to be posted, and can be viewed at any time.
- There aren't any official discussion sections.
- But we will need to have some time where we go over stuff.
- I'm planning to have office hours twice a week: Tuesday and Thursday 10-12. But I'll also be available by appointment if those times don't work, as I'm sure they won't for some people.
- We'll start with these on Zoom, but maybe it will turn out to be more productive to use something else.

## For Next Time

We'll start on saying what logic is, and why we are studying it.
