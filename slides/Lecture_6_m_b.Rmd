## Plan

- To discuss the conditional from propositional logic, the material conditional.

## Associated Reading

- Boxes and Diamonds, section 6.1-6.2

## What is It

The material implication is what the truth tables say is the conditional.

- We will write it as $A \supset B$
- This just means $\neg (A \wedge \neg B)$, i.e., $\neg A \vee B$.

One interesting hypothesis is that this is the right way to interpret English language conditionals.

## What About Hamlet

Perhaps we should say that two interesting hypotheses are that the two kinds of English language conditionals are best represented as material implications.

- Hypothesis 1: If it were the case that $A$ it would be the case that $B$ = $A \supset B$.
- Hypothesis 2: If it is the case that $A$ then it is the case that $B$ = $A \supset B$.

The first of these is wildly implausible; the second is a bit more defensible.

## Material Subjunctives?

How can you complete this sentence so that it is true?

- If the United States had entered World War II in 1939, then â€¦  \pause 

On the material implication theory, any sentence whatsoever you put in place of the dots will make this true.  \pause  That's not very plausible.

## Material Indicatives

- But the material implication theory is at least a little plausible for indicative conditionals.
- At least, some smart people have defended it

## Nine Formal Properties

1. Modus Ponens - $A, A \rightarrow B \vDash B \pause$
2. Agglomeration - $A \rightarrow B, A \rightarrow C \vDash A \rightarrow (B \wedge C)\pause$
3. Transitive - $A \rightarrow B, B \rightarrow C \vDash A \rightarrow C\pause$
4. Contraposition - $A \rightarrow B \vDash \neg B \rightarrow \neg A\pause$
5. Antecedent Strengthening - $A \rightarrow B \vDash (A \wedge C) \rightarrow B\pause$
6. Paradox 1 - $B \vDash A \rightarrow B\pause$
7. Paradox 2 - $\neg A \vDash A \rightarrow B\pause\pause$
8. Strict Paradox - $\Box B \vDash A \rightarrow B\pause$
9. Disjunction Paradox - $(A \rightarrow B) \vee (B \rightarrow A)$

## Modus Ponens

- Imagine that in some NCAA tournament, the only Big 10 teams left in the last 16 are Michigan and Ohio State.
- And in this sport, Michigan is pretty good, while Ohio State is super lucky to make the last 16. \pause 

Now consider the following two conditionals.

1. If a Big Ten team wins, then if it isn't Michigan, it will be Ohio State.
2. If Michigan doesn't win, Ohio State will win.

## Modus Ponens Counterexample?

Vann McGee made the following argument.

- Conditional 1 is true, almost by definition. \pause 
- Conditional 2 is false. \pause 
- And those judgments stay correct even if it turns out that a Big Ten team does in fact win (especially if it is Michigan). \pause 
- In general, $A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)$ and $A$ seem like they can be true but (especially when $A$ is not known) $B \rightarrow C$ can seem false.

## Agglomeration

- This is very hard to find intuitive counterexamples to.
- Take this to be a challenge.

## Transitivity

- This often sound right if you run the examples in that order.
- But it can sound very bad if you don't.

For example:

1. If I win the lottery tonight, I'll be very happy.
2. If I get hit by a car on the way home and win the lottery tonight, then I'll win the lottery tonight.
3. So if I get hit by a car on the way home and win the lottery tonight, I'll be very happy.

## Contraposition

Some of the examples to this can sound a little silly, but still they arguably do sound like English.

1. If we win this election, we won't win it by a lot.
2. So if we win by a lot, we won't win.

## Antecedent Strengthening

The same cases that are problems for transitivity are problems here.

1. If I win the lottery tonight, I'll be very happy.
2. So if I get hit by a car on the way home and win the lottery tonight, I'll be vey happy

## The Paradoxes

- These are fairly easy to generate intuitive counterexamples for.
- Note in particular that the disjunction one allows for $B = \neg A$.
- So we get the following: Either if we win, we'll lose, or if we lose, we'll win.

## For Next Time

We'll discuss the so called strict conditional.
