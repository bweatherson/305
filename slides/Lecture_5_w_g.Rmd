## Plan

- Discuss how to use tableau to show invalidity.

## Associated Reading

- Not in book.

## Two Uses of Trees

We tell that an argument is valid or that a sentence is a theorem by drawing a closed tree.

- In principle, we can also use trees to show that an argument is invalid, or that something is not a theorem.
- In practice, it's a little tricky.

## Case One: Draw an Open Tree

Imagine we're working in KT, and we want to show that $\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A$ is not a theorem. Then we really can draw a tree.

## First Problem

We typically can't just tick off the sentences as we apply the rules for them.

- Lots of the rules, especially for true $\Box$ sentences and false $\Diamond$ sentences, are open.
- So to check the tree is finished, you have to go back and look at each of these sentences, and be sure that you really really have applied all the rules.

## Second Problem

Sometimes the tree never ends.

- Imagine we're working in KT4.
- And we're trying to work out whether this is a theorem
- $\Box \Diamond A \rightarrow \Diamond \Box B$
- At one level, it's obvious that it isn't a theorem.
- But the tree is a mess.

## What Went Wrong

We can sort of kind of see the problem.

- The tree just repeats.
- Maybe we can turn that into a model.

## The General Recipe

What shows something is not a theorem is a model where it is false at a world.

- Take the open tree.
- Each number on the tree is a world.
- World $x$ is always related to world $x.y$.
- Add R-relations that are required by the relevant restrictions.
- Read truth for atomic sentences off what the tree says. It should be reasonably specific, though often it will leave gaps.

## The Harder Case

What to do if the tree doesn't close.

1. Describe (but obviously don't draw) the infinite model.
2. Draw a model where one world stands in for many different strings of numbers.

## For Up/Down Verdicts

If you can see that the tree will cycle and never complete, that's sort of good enough.

## For Next Time

We'll end by going over a whole bunch of examples.
