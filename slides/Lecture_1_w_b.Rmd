## Plan for Today

We're going to introduce how we prove negations in Carnap.

## How to Prove a Negation

Show that if it were true, something absurd would follow.

## Absurdity

> - In engineering, a perpetual motion machine, or some other kind of free energy.
> - In finance, a risk-free way to make a guaranteed profit.
> - In logic, a sentence and its negation.

## Structure of Proof

1. Say that we will show $\neg X$
2. Assume $X$
3. Derive some pair of sentences, $Y$ and $\neg Y$
4. Close the indirect proof by listing the lines where $Y$ and $\neg Y$ appear.
5. Say that $\neg X$ has been shown at the 'show' line, and not citing any of the lines between it and the 'Indirect Proof' line.

## Example

To prove: $P \rightarrow Q, P \rightarrow \neg Q \vdash \neg P$

```
1. Show: ~P
2.     P         :AS
3.     P -> Q    :PR
4.     P -> ~Q   :PR
5.     Q         :MP 2, 3
6.     ~Q        :MP 2, 4
7. :ID 5 6
```

## Notes

> - We indent all the lines between 'show' and 'id' - this is a subproof just like in conditional derivation.
> - The pair of lines cited have to be one sentence, and the negation of that very sentence.
> - Oddly, we don't put a comma between the lines cited at the end.
> - Once you end the sub-proof, you can't cite lines from in it again.
> - But in the sub-proof, you can cite lines from earlier; they could even be one of the pair of lines that make up the absurdity.

## One More Example

To prove: $P \rightarrow Q, R \rightarrow \neg Q \vdash R \rightarrow \neg P$

```
1. Show: R -> ~P
2.     R                 :AS
3.     P -> Q            :PR
4.     R -> ~Q           :PR
5.     ~Q                :MP 2, 4
6.     Show: ~P
7.         P             :AS
8.         Q             :MP 3,7
9.     :ID 5 8
10. :CD 6
```

## For Next Time

We will talk about an interesting general fact about what you can prove in Carnap.
